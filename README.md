## Installation
You can install the Validator component using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
composer require legatus/validator
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

$validator = Legatus\Http\Validator::build($psr7Request)
    ->body('id')->required()->uuid()
    ->body('name.first')->string()->required()
    ->body('name.middle')->string()
    ->body('name.last')->string()->required()
    ->body('password')->string()->required()->min(6)->password()->max(30)
    ->body('birthdate')->string()->date()->before('-18years')
    ->body('promo_code')->custom(new Legatus\Http\PromoCode()) // And instance of rule or a callable
    ->body('emails.*')->email()
    ->body('addresses.*.lineOne')->required()->string()
    ->body('addresses.*.lineTwo')->string()
    ->body('addresses.*.city')->required()->string()
    ->body('addresses.*.zip')->string()
    ->body('addresses.*.country')->enum(['CL', 'GB', 'US'])
    ->getValidator();

try {
    $data = $validator->validate();
} catch (Legatus\Http\ValidationFailed $e) {
    // $data = $e->getData();
}

[$id, $name, $password, $birthDate, $promoCode, $emails, $addresses] = $data->values();

```

## Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
